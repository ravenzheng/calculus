### Section 10.3 Taylor Series
p714: 2, 3, 4 (generate from scratch the series in #9, 10, 11, 21, 24, 70
On 10.3, for #9, 10, 11 use an actual test (Ratio etc.) with the kth term formula of the series to determine the interval of convergence after you find those series from scratch.
p714: #29, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 39, 41, 47, 52, 61abd, 62, 63, 76
On #47 you do not need to find the interval of convergence (although notice the endpoints would change which one is included due to the alternating series test)
