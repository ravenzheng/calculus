### 2.2 Definition of Limits

> **Definition Limit of a Function(Preliminary)**
Suppose the function $f$ is defined for all $x$ near $a$ except > possibly at $a$. If $f(x)$ is arbitrarily close to $L$ (as close to L > as we like) for all $x$ sufficiently close (but not equal) to $a$, we write
$$
\lim_{x \to a}{f(x)} = L
$$

Informally, we say that $\dlim_{x \to a}{f(x)}$ if f(x) get closer and closer to $L$ as $x$ gets closer and closer to $a$ from both sides. The value of $\lim_{x \to a}{f(x)}$(if it exists) depends upon the value of $f$ near $a$, but it does not depend on the value of $f(a)$. In some cases, the $\dlim_{x \to a}{f(x)}$ equals $f(a)$. In other instances, $\dlim_{x \to a}{f(x)}$ and $f(a)$ differ, or $f(a)$ may not even be defined.

#### One-sided limits
The limit $\lim_{x \to a}{f(x)} = L$ is referred to as a two-sided limit because $f(x)$ approachs $L$ as $x$ approaches $a$ for values of $x$ less than $a$ and for values greater than $a$. For some functions, it makes sense to examine one-sided limit called left-sided and right-sided limits.

>**Definition One-sided limit**
**Right-sided limit** Suppose $f$ is defined for all $x$ near $a$ > with $x>a$. If $f(x)$ is arbitrarily close to $L$ for all $x$ > sufficiently close to a with $x>a$, we write
$$
\lim_{x \to a^+}{f(x)} = L
$$
and say the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ from the right > equals $L$.
**Left-sided limit** Suppose $f$ is defined for all $x$ near $a$ > with $x<a$. If $f(x)$ is arbitrarily close to $L$ for all $x$ > sufficiently close to a with $x<a$, we write
$$
\lim_{x \to a^-}{f(x)} = L
$$
and say the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ from the left equals > $L$.

>**Theorem 2.1 Relationship Between One-sided and Two-sided Limits**
Assume $f$ is defined for all $x$ near $a$ except possibly at $a$. Then $\dlim_{x \to a}{f(x)} = L$ if and only if $\dlim_{x \to a^+}{f(x)} = L$ and $\dlim_{x \to a^-}{f(x)} = L$
