### 2.4 Infinite Limits

An *infinite limit* occurs when function values increases or decreases without bound near a point. The other type of limit, known as *a limit at infinity*, occurs when the independent variable x increase or decrease without bound.

#### An Overview
For an *infinite limit*, the *dependent variable* becomes arbitrarily large in magnitude as the *independent variable* approaches a finite number.
With *limits at infinity*, the dependent variable approaches a finite number as the independent variable becomes arbitrarity large in magnitude.

#### Infinite Limits
>Definition Infinite Limits
Suppose f is defined for all x near a. If f(x) grows arbitrarily large for all x sufficiently close (but not equal) to a, we write
$$
\lim_{x \to a}{f(x)} = \infty
$$
We say the limit of f(x) as x approaches a is infinity.
If f(x) is negative and grows arbitrarily large for all x sufficiently close (but not equal) to a, we write
$$
\lim_{x \to a}{f(x)} = -\infty
$$
In this case, we say the limit of f(x) as x approaches a is negative infinity. In both cases, the limit does not exist.
