### Section 9.6 Alternating Series
p677: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 19, 11, 13, 15, 22, 24, 27, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 52, 53, 54, 57bdg, 61 (On #11-27 below, if sequence diverges note test used.)

1\. Explain why the sequence of partial sums for an alternating series is not an increasing sequence.

2\. Describe how to apply the Alternating Series Test.

6\. Give an example of a convergent alternating series that fails to converge absolutely.

7\. Is it possible for a series of positive terms to converge condition- ally? Explain.

9\. Is it possible for an alternating series to converge absolutely but not conditionally?
