5\. Why must integration be used to find the work required to pump water out of a tank?
>**Solution**
Different volume of water are moved different distance.

27\. **Emptying a swimming pool** A swimming pool has the shape of a box with a base that measures $25 m$ by $15 m$ and a uniform depth of $2.5 m$. How much work is required to pump the water out of the pool when it is full?
>**Solution**
$$
\eqalign{
A(y)&= 25\cdot 15 = 375,  D(y) = 2.5-y\\
W &= \int_0^{2.5} \rho g A(y) D(y)dy\\
&= 375\rho g \int_0^{2.5} (2.5-y) dy\\
&= 11484375 J
}
$$

28\. **Emptying a cylindrical** tank A cylindrical water tank has height 8 m and radius $2 m$. Graph (28).
a. If the tank is full of water, how much work is required to pump the water to the level of the top of the tank and out of the tank?
>**Solution**
$$
\eqalign{
A(y)&= 4\pi, D(y) = 8-y\\
W &= \int_0^8 \rho g A(y) D(y)dy\\
&= 4\pi \rho g\int_0^8 (8-y) dy\\
&\approx 3940814 J
}

29\. **Emptying a half-full cylinderical tank** Suppose the water tank in Exercise 28 is half-full of water. Determine the work required to empty the tank by pumping the water to a level $2 m$ above the top of the tank.
>**Solution**
$$
\eqalign{
A(y)&= 4\pi, D(y) = 10-y\\
W &= \int_0^4 \rho g A(y) D(y)dy\\
&= 4\pi \rho g \int_0^4 (10-y) dy\\
&\approx 3940814 J
}
$$

31\. **Emptying a conical tank** A water tank is shaped like an inverted cone with height 6 m and base radius $1.5 m$. Graph (31).
a. If the tank is full, how much work is required to pump the water to the level of the top of the tank and out of the tank?
>**Solution**
$$
\eqalign{
A(y)&= \pi(\frac{y}{4})^2,  D(y) = 6-y \\
W &= \int_0^6 \rho g A(y) D(y)dy\\
&= \frac{\pi}{16} \rho g \int_0^6 y^2(6-y) dy\\
&= 66150\pi J
}
$$

b. Is it true that it takes half as much work to pump the water out of the tank when it is filled to half its depth as when it is full? Explain.
>**Solution**
False. $\dint_0^3 \rho g \pi \frac{y^2}{16} (6-y)dy = \frac{135\rho g \pi}{64}$ and $\dint_3^6 \rho g \pi \frac{y^2}{16} (6-y)dy = \frac{297\rho g \pi}{64}$.

34\. Emptying a water trough A water trough has a semicircular cross section with a radius of $0.25 m$ and a length of $3 m$ (see figure).
a. How much work is required to pump the water out of the trough when it is full?
b. If the length is doubled, is the required work doubled? Explain.
c. If the radius is doubled, is the required work doubled? Explain.
>**Solution**
$$
\eqalign{
A(y)&= 3\cdot 2 \sqrt{0.25^2-(0.25-y)^2}, D(y) = 0.25-y \\
W &= \int_0^{0.25} \rho g A(y) D(y)dy\\
&= 6\rho g\int_0^{0.25} \sqrt{0.25^2-(0.25-y)^2}(0.25-y) dy\\
&= 306.25
}
$$
b. Yes
c. No.

36\. **Pumping water** Suppose the tank in Example 4 is full of water (rather than half-full of gas). Determine the work required to pump all the water to an outlet pipe $15 m$ above the bottom of the tank. Graph (36).
>**Solution**
$$
\eqalign{
A(y)&= 20 \sqrt{25-y^2}, D(y) = 10-y\\
W &= \int_{-5}^5 \rho g A(y) D(y)dy\\
&= 20\rho g \int_{-5}^5 \sqrt{25-y^2}(10-y) dy\\
&\approx 7.70\cdot 10^7 J
}
$$

37\. **Emptying a conical tank** An inverted cone is $2 m$ high and has a base radius of $\inv{2} m$. If the tank is full, how much work is required to pump the water to a level $1 m$ above the top of the tank? Graph (37).
>**Solution**
$$
\eqalign{
A(y)&= \frac{y^2}{16} \pi, D(y) = 3-y\\
W &= \int_0^2 \rho g A(y) D(y)dy\\
&= \frac{\pi}{16}\rho g \int_0^2 y^2(3-y) dy\\
&\approx 7696.9
}
