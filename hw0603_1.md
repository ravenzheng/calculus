p419: 1, 7, 8, 10, 12.

1\. Suppose a cut is made through a solid object perpendicular to the x-axis at a particular point $x$. Explain the meaning of $A(x)$.
>**Solution**
$A(x)$ is the area of the cross section of the solid object at point $x$.

7â€“16\. **General slicing method** Use the general slicing method to find the volume of the following solids.
7\. The solid whose base is the region bounded by the curves $y = x^2$ and $y = 2 - x^2$ and whose cross sections through the solid perpendicular to the x-axis are squares.
>**Solution**
$x^2=2-x^2 \To x=\pm 1$. $y = x^2$ and $y = 2 - x^2$ intersect at points $x=\pm 1$.
$$
\eqalign{
A(x) &= [x^2 - (2-x^2)]^2 = 4x^4-8x^2+4\\
V_{Riemann Sum} &= \sum_{k=1}^n A(x_k)\Delta x = \sum_{k=1}^n (4x_k^4-8x_k^2+4)\Delta x\\
V &= \int_{-1}^1 A(x)dx\\
&= 8\int_0^1 (x^4-2x^2+1)dx\\
&= 8(\inv{5}x^5 -\frac{2}{3}x^3 + x) \mid_0^1 = \frac{64}{15}
}
$$

8\. The solid whose base is the region bounded by the semicircle $y = \sqrt {1 - x^2}$ and the x-axis and whose cross sections through the solid perpendicular to the x-axis are squares.
>**Solution**
With the cross sections being **squares**
$$
\eqalign{
V_{square} &= \int_{-1}^1 (1-x^2)dx\\
&= 2(x-\inv{3}x^3) \mid_0^1 = \frac{4}{3}
}
$$
With the cross sections being **semicircles**
$$
\eqalign{
V_{semicircle} &= \int_{-1}^1 \frac{\pi}{2}(\frac{\sqrt{1-x^2}}{2})^2dx\\
&= \pi(x-\inv{3}x^3) \mid_0^1 = \frac{\pi}{6}
}
$$

10\. The solid with a circular base of radius 5 whose cross sections perpendicular to the base and parallel to the x-axis are equilateral triangles.
>**Solution**
$$
\eqalign{
A(y) &=\frac{\sqrt 3}{4} \lb\sqrt {25-y^2} - (-\sqrt {25-y^2})\rb ^2\\
&= \sqrt 3(25 -y^2)\\
V &= \int_{-5}^5 A(y)dy\\
&= 2\sqrt 3(25y - \inv{3}y^3) \mid_0^5 = \frac{500}{3}\sqrt 3
}
$$

12\. The solid whose base is the region bounded by $y = x^2$ and the line $y = 1$ and whose cross sections perpendicular to the base and parallel to the x-axis are squares.
>**Solution**
$$
\eqalign{
A(y) &= (\sqrt y- (-\sqrt y))^2 = 4y\\
V_{Riemann Sum} &= \sum_{k=1}^n 4y_k \Delta y\\
V &= \int_0^1 A(y)dy\\
&= 2y^2 \mid_0^1 = 2
}
$$
